# My First Site
  
### Description :   
This project is my first site about some games.   

The site is not very pretty, but it allowed me to see what I could potentially improve for my next site.  
For example, the color and arrangement of the different elements on the pages are really not great.  
**But this is where I can improve!**  
  
### What I learned : 
I learned how to do the basics of a site and how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
  
### Specifications :  
For this project I use HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
I was a project for my first year of computer science degree.  
And it was made on Windows(comments in French).  
Made at the start of 2021.
